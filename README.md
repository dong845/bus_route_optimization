# bus_route_optimization

## DFS explore with score & Genering Data

- bplanner_f.py: final version for optimizing the current route based on building score function.

- make_data_new.py: build training graph data set whose node number is under 275.

- make_data_test.py: build some large actual graph test data.

## ACO (Ongoing)

- aco_search.py: use aco algorithm for exploring optimized routes.

- aco_search_v1.py: use aco algorithm for exploring optimized routes. (broaden the range to build larger graph, which covers more points and edges)
