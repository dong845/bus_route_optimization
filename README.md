# bus_route_optimization

- bplanner_f.py: final version for optimizing the current route based on building score function.

- make_data_new.py: build training graph data set whose node number is under 275.

- make_data_test.py: build some large actual graph test data.

- aco_search.py: use aco algorithm for exploring optimized routes. (Still needs to make some changes to the code).
